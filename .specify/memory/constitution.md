# Project Constitution

> Governing principles for virtual-closet.
> All specifications and implementations must align with these principles.

## Core Principles

### P1: User-Centric Simplicity

The app must be intuitive and effortless to use daily. Adding clothing items, planning outfits, and viewing recommendations should take seconds, not minutes. Every feature should reduce decision fatigue, not add to it.

### P2: Professional-First Design

The primary use case is planning professional work attire. All features, suggestions, and interfaces should prioritize helping users look appropriate and confident in workplace settings while avoiding repetition.

### P3: Context-Aware Intelligence

Outfit suggestions must intelligently consider weather, occasion, dress code, and recent outfit history. The system should learn from user preferences and provide increasingly relevant recommendations over time.
